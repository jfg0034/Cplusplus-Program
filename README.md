# Cplusplus-Program: Banking app

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.  
  This project was created to provide a way for users to see how much their invested money would increase over the years according to their choice for initial
  capital, interest rate, length of investment, and if they were willing to periodically invest a set amount each month.
  A table then would display the differences in yearly interests whether a monthly investment is set or not.

# What did you do particularly well?
  I think I did well on how I structured my main program, very short and simple, relying mostly on the creation of objects and custom functions to ensure the
  program behaved as expected.

  I believe I could probably enhance this code by incorporating exception-handling constructs such as try, throw, and catch when validating user input, in order
  to make the code much more readable.

  Probably the most challenging was ensuring that user input did not break the code for wrongly introducing a different type of variable than the required one.
  Although it is possible a different and better approach could be done, I decided to consider all user input as a string and evaluate if it could properly be
  transformed into the required type of variable.

  I believe that the most important skill I could take from this project was thinking the composition of a program as a composition of custom functions and objects 
  that behave differently as needed. 

  I made this program thinking that anyone would be able to understand, following industry standards, and implementing comments anywhere it seemed extra explanation
  was needed. Anyone then would be able to take my code and improve it or modify it to a similar project.
